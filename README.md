I am an analytical and creative Junior Developer. I am looking for a role where I can extend my programming knowledge and experience.

After graduating from Imperial College, I spent 7 years working in the localisation industry, first at a localisation agency and later at Canon Europe. I have worked in translation, project management, localisation engineering and graphic design. As my role and my interest becomes more and more technical, I have decided to become a full-time developer.

I have completed a course at Makers Academy, a 16 week software development bootcamp, and I am looking forward to develop my skills further.
