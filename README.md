I am a Junior Developer with design expertise and over 3 years' experience in a technical role.

After graduating from Imperial College, I spent 7 years working in the localisation industry. My last job was Localisation Engineer at Canon Europe. My previous roles involve design and engineering for firmware, software, web and apps. As my role and my interest becomes more and more technical, I have decided to become a full-time developer.

I have completed a course at Makers Academy, an intensive software development bootcamp. My experience at Makers Academy has engrained in me the importance of best coding practices, such as Agile, OOD and TDD. I am looking for a Junior Developer role where I can follow those practices in a supportive environment.

I am currently learning React Native, Node.js and taking AWS Certified Solutions Architect courses.

I am also writing a blog on [learning React Native from scratch](https://medium.com/@mengchenwang/learning-react-native-from-scratch-4d9873eb9fac).

Tech Skills : JavaScript, Node.js, React Native, jQuery, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, Ruby, Rails
